    # Welcome to Hyfryd

    Hyfryd is an opinionated application framework built on Hiraeth.  It takes a view-first component-based approach, using Tailwind, HTMX and AlpineJS to create dynamic and fast experiences with the full power of PHP and Twig.

    [Skip to Components]({{ route('/components') }}).

    ## Installation

    1. [Install Hiraeth](https://hiraeth.dev/docs/3.0/installation)
    2. Add Hyfryd

    ```
    composer require hiraeth/hyfrid
    ```
{% endapply %}

<x:alert:info ghost class:="border-dashed">
    {% apply markdown %}
        You can install Hyfryd into an existing project to make use of its components, however, if you're already making use of static pages, read about our [pitfalls](#pitfalls).
    {% endapply %}
</x:alert:info>

{% apply markdown %}
    ## Creating Pages {: #pages}

    Hyfryd use's Hiraeth's [static templates](https://hiraeth.dev/docs/latest/pages#static-templates) with the template prefix of `%` (instead of `@`).  This indicates the template is a partial template (a percent of a page) and can be returned by the template middleware in the event of an AJAX or HTMX request.  So, to create your first page, simply add a new file:

    {: .mb-0}
    `resources/pages/%index.html`
    ```xml
    <title>Welcome to Hyfryd!</title>
    <x:alert:info ghost class:="border-dashed">
        Hello World!
    </x:alert:info>
    ```

    Creating other pages is as simple as creating the directory and file structure you want under `resources/pages`.  Depending on whether or not the URL ends in a slash (`/`) determine the canonical location of the template:

    |URI Path|Canonical Template Location|
    |-|-|
    |**`/docs/`**|`resources/pages/docs/%index.html`|
    |**`/docs`**|`resources/pages/%docs.html`|
{% endapply %}

<x:alert:info ghost class:="border-dashed">
    In both cases, if the template cannot be found at the canonical location but the alternative is found, Hyfryd will redirect the user to the canonical path.
</x:alert:info>

    ## Branching (Routing) {: #branching}

    One of the major reasons modern backend applications use routers is because we want to make nice clean URLs based on informaton provided in URL segments.  Hyfryd uses a concept called branching instead, which makes use of the existing filesystem hierarchy corresponding to request paths to replace segments that match certain patterns while parsing them and populating the mapped parameters.  So, what do you do if you to access `/users/1`, parse the `1` as the user ID, and render it with a detail template?

    {: .mb-0}
    `resources/pages/users/~matchers.jin`
    ```json
    [detail]

        pattern = ([1-9][0-9]*)
        mapping = [
            "id"
        ]
    ```
{% endapply %}

<x:alert:info ghost class:="border-dashed">
    Each matching group within the pattern RegEx corresponds to a parameter in the mapping.
</x:alert:info>

{% apply markdown %}
    Using the above `~matchers.jin` configuration, the `1` will match the pattern, and the template lookup for that segment will be replaced with `detail`.   Now you can simply create a `resources/users/%detail.html` file and get your user:

    ```xml {% verbatim %}
    <x:alert:info>
        You selected the user with the id of
        {{ parameters.id }}
    </x:alert:info>
    {% endverbatim %}```

    Matched paraemters will stack along the way, so they would also be available in any templates downstream, e.g. `/users/1/edit`:

    {: .mb-0}
    `resources/pages/users/detail/%edit.html`
    ```xml {% verbatim %}
    <x:alert:info>
        You selected to EDIT the user with the id
        of {{ parameters.id }}
    </x:alert:info>
    {% endverbatim %}```

    ## Adding Actions {: #actions}

    You may be wondering at this point, without controllers, how do I get data into my templates?  While it's possible to install additional packages that perform traditional routing (e.g. `hiraeth/fastroute`), Hyfryd promotes a view-first approach.  This approach provides a few benefits:

    1. Different views can easily re-use the same control logic and get the same data.  Compared to a traditional router => controller approach, you'd need to update the controller to determine the appropriate template to respond with and under what conditions.
    2. Since called actions respond directly with arrays of data, actions can be re-used with a router to automatically provide functional API endpoints with no additional changes needed in most cases.
    3. Provides larger caching surface area prior dependency resolution, faster lookups and a lower memory footprint per-request without the need to load routing tables or validate targets.

    To get started with an action, just add your class:

    {: .mb-0}
    `local/User/Details.php`
    ```php
    namespace User;

    class Details extends \AbstractAction
    {
        public function __construct(protected UserRepository $users)
        {

        }

        public function __invoke(int $id)
        {
            $user = $this->users->find($id);

            if (!$user) {
                return $this->response(404);
            }

            return [
                'user' => $user;
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

    Then call the action in your template:

    ```xml {% verbatim %}
    {% do action('User:Details') %}

    <h1>{{ user.name }}</h1>
    <p>
        This user was created on {{ user.dateCreated|date('d/m/Y') }}
        and has {{ user.friends|length }} friend(s).
    </p>
    {% endverbatim %}```
{% endapply %}

<x:alert:info ghost class:="border-dashed">
    {% apply markdown %}
        Remember, the parameters from your `~matchers.jin` file are available and will automatically be mapped to the `__invoke()` method on your action.  If you need to overload a parameter you can pass them as a second argument to the `action()` method, e.g. `{id: 2}`.
    {% endapply %}
</x:alert:info>

{% apply markdown %}
    ## Production {: #production}

    By default, CDN-based dependencies are used for all front-end libraries including Tailwind, HTMX, and AlpineJS.  This is designed to make development and prototyping faster out of the box.  This also works well for very basic cases, however, more advanced users will likely want to build or bundle their own front-end assets, add custom tags, or modify the basic body structure.

    If you opt to build or bundle your own custom assets, you'll want to make sure you target:

    - Tailwind 4.x
    - HTMLX 2.x
    - AlpineJS 3.x

    To begin this process, you want to overload and extend the supplied entry point (`@index.html`).  This begins by simply creating a new file:

    {: .mb-0}
    `resources/pages/@index.html`
    ```xml{% verbatim %}
    {% extends '@vendor/hiraeth/hyfryd/resources/pages/@index.html' %}
    {% endverbatim %}```

    This template includes two overloadable blocks, `head` and `body`.  Each of these corresponds to the brunt of the HTML element with the same name.

    ### Head

    The `head` block is responsible for loading all assets, ergo, if you want to build a production CSS file with tailwind.  This is where to start.  As a simple example, let's take a look at what this site uses.  Add the following:

    ```xml{% verbatim %}
    {% block head %}
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net" />
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />

        <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/htmx.org@2.x.x/dist/htmx.min.js" crossorigin></script>
        <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js" crossorigin></script>

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/app.css" />
    {% endblock %}
    {% endverbatim %}```

    Here, we continue using the CDN version of HTMX and AlpineJS, but for our CSS, we opt to use a compiled file.  Which build or bundling system you use is up to you.  However, in the case of Tailwind, you want to ensure that you import the following:

    |Source|Description|
    |-|-|
    |`vendor/hiraeth/hyfryd/sources.css`|Ensures Tailwind sources appropriate directories, namely, `resources`.
    |`vendor/hiraeth/hyfryd/themes/<theme>.css`|Includes a selected theme, replace `<theme>` with desire theme.

    Continuing with the example of this site, we add the following:

    {: .mb-0}
    `resources/app.css`
    ```css
    @import '../vendor/hiraeth/hyfryd/sources.css';
    @import '../vendor/hiraeth/hyfryd/themes/default.css';
    ```

    As well as a simplified package and build process:

    {: .mb-0 }
    `package.json`
    ```json
    {
    "dependencies": {
        "@tailwindcss/cli": "^4.0.14",
        "tailwindcss": "^4.0.14"
    },
    "scripts": {
        "start": "concurrently --kill-others 'npm run watch' 'npm run serve'",
        "watch": "npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./resources/app.css -o ./public/assets/app.css --watch",
        "build": "npx @tailwindcss/cli --minify -i ./resources/app.css -o ./public/assets/app.css",
        "serve": "php bin/server"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "concurrently": "^9.1.2"
    }
    }
    ```

    Using the above, you can run development and watch for changes via:

    ```
    npm run start
    ```

    Or build for production with:

    ```
    npm run build
    ```

    ### Body

    The default `body` block is a single `<main>` element which acts as the HTMX boost load target.  In most cases you're going to want to put things like navigational elements outside of this target and not reload them on every page (which is kinda the point).

    To do this, add another block to your entry point ensuring that the element which should load boosted partials by default has the `portal` ID, e.g. `id="portal"`:

    {: .mb-0}
    `resources/pages/@index.html`
    ```xml{% verbatim %}
    {% block body %}
        <!-- nav or starting wrappers -->
        <main id="portal">
            <!-- boosted partials will be loaded here -->
        </main>
        <!-- footer or ending wrappers -->
    {% endblock %}
    {% endverbatim %}```

    ## Pitfalls {: #pitfalls}

    While we attempt to ensure this is as easy to develop with as possible, there are handful of common pitfalls to be aware of.

    ### Integrating

    If you already have an existing Hiraeth install and, in particular, if you're using static pages, you can still use the Hyfryd components.  It's **important** to note, however, that because Hyfryd is intended to be a fuller application framework that uses HTMX's boost functionality for partial page loads (by default), the `~matchers.jin` at the root of its template path consumes any and all non-HTMX requests paths entirely.

    If you have an existing `~matchers.jin` in your `resources/pages` folder, then this will not cause any problems for your existing `@template.html` pages, however, if you don't, you'll want to overload it by creating an empty `resources/pages/~matchers.jin`.

    ### Safelisting

    While not as much a pitfall of Hyfryd as much as it is of Tailwind, it should be noted that components which create or include dynamic classes, i.e. where a portion of the class is a Twig variable or has been otherwise formed by an expression, may not be recognized by Tailwind.  This is less true with the CDN as it's already operating on rendered code, however, when building for production any such classes need to be "safelisted."

    Hyfryd maintains its own safelisting for built-in components which is "sourced" via the `@import` of the `vendor/hiraeth/hyfryd/sources.css` file.  To add your own safelist (although this might change in the future, you can simply add a `resources/safelist.html` containing the static versions of any dynamically generated classes.
{% endapply %}

<x:alert:warn ghost>
    If a class appears on an HTML element and is otherwise a valid Tailwind utility class, but the styles are not taking effect, it is highly likely that said class was created and added dynamically, so Tailwind couldn't find it during the build.
</x:alert:warn>
