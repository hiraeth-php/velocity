<h1>Welcome to Velocity</h1>
<p>
    Velocity is an application and component framework built on <a href="https://hiraeth.dev" hx-boost="false">Hiraeth</a> that makes rapidly developing site and application prototypes a breeze.  Using lightweight alternatives to heavy front-end frameworks, Velocity provides a server-side rendered component system capable of building modern and dynamic front-ends with the speed, efficiency, and power of PHP and Twig.
